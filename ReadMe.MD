I'd be glad to assist you in creating a comprehensive response to the prompt, combining the strengths of Response A and Response B while addressing their shortcomings and incorporating insights from the ratings:

Prompt:

Write Spring Boot Microservice with Google sign in with authentication and authorisation with admin role and non admin role login and docker image deployment using helm chart and code should be ready to push in GitHub

Comprehensive Response:

Here's a well-structured guide and code implementation for building a Spring Boot microservice with Google Sign-in, authentication, authorization (admin and non-admin roles), login functionality, Docker image deployment, and Helm chart:

1. Project Setup:

Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) with the following dependencies:
Spring Web
Spring Security
Spring Security OAuth2 Client
Spring Boot Webstarter Actuator (for health checks)
Optionally, use Spring Data JPA and a database (e.g., MySQL) for user management (covered later).
Configure your project's properties (application.properties):
Google OAuth2 Client ID and Secret (obtain from Google Cloud Console)
Security configuration (authentication provider, user roles, etc.)
Port number
2. Google Sign-in Integration:

Use Spring Security's @EnableOAuth2Client and @PreAuthorize annotations for Google Sign-in and authorization.
Implement a GoogleLoginController to handle the Google Sign-in flow:
Redirect to Google's authorization endpoint with necessary parameters.
Receive the authorization code, exchange it for an access token, and retrieve user information from Google's API.
Create or authenticate the user in your system, storing relevant details (e.g., email, ID, roles).
Redirect back to your application's authorized home page.
3. Authentication and Authorization:

Configure Spring Security with the Google OAuth2 client and necessary authentication providers (e.g., in-memory user store or database).
Use @PreAuthorize annotations on controllers or methods to enforce authorization based on user roles (e.g., "ADMIN", "USER").
Consider integrating with a database (e.g., using Spring Data JPA) to store user roles and other information more persistently.
4. Login Functionality:

Create a login page (e.g., using Thymeleaf, React, etc.) with a button for Google Sign-in.
Handle the button click to trigger the Google Sign-in flow described in step 2.
Upon successful authentication and authorization, redirect the user to the appropriate home page based on their role.
5. Docker Image Deployment:

Create a Dockerfile to build your Spring Boot application image:
Base image: openjdk:17-alpine (or a suitable Java image)
Copy application files
Expose port
Run the application
Build the image using docker build -t your-app-image . and push it to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) using docker push your-app-image.
6. Helm Chart:

Create a Helm chart to manage deployment:
Define values.yaml with configuration details (image name, port, etc.).
Use manifests (Deployment, Service) to orchestrate deployment.
Deploy the chart using helm install your-chart-name -f values.yaml.
7. GitHub Repository:

Create a GitHub repository to store your project code.
Initialize it with git init.
Add files and commit them using git add and git commit.
Push to GitHub using git push origin main.
Code Example (Illustrative, adapt to your project structure):
